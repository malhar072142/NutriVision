## **Installation**

To set up and run NutriVision locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/NutriVision.git` and navigate to the project directory with `cd NutriVision`.
2. Create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv nutrivision_env`. Activate it using `source nutrivision_env/bin/activate` for macOS/Linux or `nutrivision_env\Scripts\activate` for Windows.
3. Install all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Add your OpenAI API key by creating a `.env` file in the project root and adding the line `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key`. Alternatively, use Streamlit's Secrets Management for deployment.

---

## **Usage**

To run the NutriVision application, use the command `streamlit run nutrivision_app.py`. Once the app starts, you can:

1. Upload an image of food, such as pizza or a burger.
2. View the predicted food category.
3. Access detailed nutritional information, including calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates.
4. Get dietary insights generated by GPT-4.
